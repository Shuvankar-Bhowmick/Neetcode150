APPROACH 1: Approach is pretty simple.
    1. We will find out the distance of each point from the origin and store it along with it's coordinates
       in a min heap in the form of a tuple
    2. Then we will loop the min heap for k times and append the second value of the tuple to our answer list ðŸ˜€   
APPROACH 2: Apply quicksort/quickselect    
dist(nums[i]) = x**2 + y **2, pivot = dist(nums[r])
compare between nums[i] and pivot and sort the nums array 

OBSERVATION: On theory the quickselect algorithm is supposed to run faster than the min heap one, but p]ractically the reverse happens as the min heap takes an approx of 750ms while the quickselect (iterative) one takes around 960-1000 ms. 

REASON: This is most probably due to the distribution of the array where sometimes the array might be in a sorted state thereby increasing the time complexity to O(n^2) (worst case), the only reason the code is still working for a large input is because the pivot has been randomized which reduces the possible bottleneck that may arise due to this condition. 

RECOMMENDATION: Use the min heap approach (Approach 1) in interviews as it takes less time and is easily readable, if the interviewer asks for a more optimized solution (theoretically) thereafter, then explain to him Approach 2
